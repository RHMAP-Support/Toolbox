App to perform test cloud call and miscellaneous checks.  

The app works on 2 levels.  The first being as an app to be deployed on a device.  

Currently, it performs 2 functions, perform a Redis call and perform a ditch call.
These can be accessed by pressing the relevent buttons under the "Test CLoud Functionality"
button.

The 2nd level this app works is as a health check.  The app exposes 3 endpoints 
(Redis, Ditch and General Health).  These are monitored in pingdom.
